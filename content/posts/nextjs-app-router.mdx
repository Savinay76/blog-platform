# Exploring Next.js 14 App Router

The **App Router** in Next.js 14 introduces a new paradigm for building applications using React Server Components.

## Key Features

1.  **Server Components**: Fetch data directly in your components.
2.  **Streaming**: Send UI to the client as soon as it's ready.
3.  **Layouts**: Share UI between routes.

```tsx
// app/page.tsx
export default async function Page() {
  const data = await getData()
  return <main>{data}</main>
}
```

This makes building performant apps easier than ever.
