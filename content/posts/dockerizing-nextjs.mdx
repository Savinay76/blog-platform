# Dockerizing Next.js Applications

Deploying Next.js with Docker ensures consistency across environments.

## The Dockerfile

Here is a multi-stage `Dockerfile` optimized for production:

```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine AS base

FROM base AS deps
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./
RUN npm ci

FROM base AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=deps /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY . .
RUN npm run build
```

This keeps your image size small and secure.
