# Mastering Tailwind CSS v4

Tailwind CSS v4 brings a new engine that is faster and more powerful.

## What's New?

-   **Zero-runtime**: No more `postcss` dependency chain issues.
-   **Automatic content detection**: No more `purge` config.
-   **CSS Variables**: Native support for everything.

### Example

```html
<div class="bg-blue-500 text-white p-4 rounded-lg shadow-lg">
  Hello Tailwind!
</div>
```

It's amazing how fast you can build UIs.
